# caesar-cipher

This is a simple Ruby implementation of the **Caesar Cipher**, a basic encryption technique that shifts letters in a given text by a specified number of positions. The program preserves case and ignores non-alphabetic characters.

## Usage
Run the script and provide a text input along with a shift value to encrypt the text.

## Example
```
caesar_cipher("Hello, World!", 3) # Output: "Khoor, Zruog!"
```
